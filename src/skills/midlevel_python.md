# Intermediate Python Experience

A midlevel python developer knows python's data structures basic control functions and how to implement common python modules.  With a firm grasp on OOP this skillset includes creating classes, extending them and overriding their methods.

Ability to reuse code, review code written by other developers, and have working projects running _in the wild_ written by me.
