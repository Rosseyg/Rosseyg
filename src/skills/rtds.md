# Resistance Temperature Detectors

(RTDs) are the industry standard temperature sensor using electrical resistance as the property that changes due to temp.  They are sold as 2,3,and 4 wire devices and the more wires the higher the __precision__.  


## Analog or digital?

Well, they are both. The electrical signal physically traveling through the sensor is _analog_ but an rtd sensor is always attached to some type of controller or input device that is responsible for providing the sensor with a source and making sense of that signal by converting it to a digital value.  _Ones and zeros_

## RTDs versus

The other popular type is a thermocouple which uses voltage difference across a bimetal probe to determine temp
