# Resistance Temperature Detectors ðŸŒ¡

(RTDs) are the industry standard temperature sensor using electrical resistance as the property that changes with temp.  They are sold as 2,3,and 4 wire devices and the more wires, the more __precision__.  There are different resistances and element materials available to buy, commonly nickle and platinium at 100 - 1000 ohms.  These specs are not interchangable, each controller / RTD input device on the market has specific requirements as to the type of RTD they interface with.


## Analog or digital? ðŸ¤–

Well, they are both. The electrical signal physically traveling through the sensor is _analog_ but an rtd sensor is always attached to some type of controller or input device that is responsible for providing the sensor with a source and making sense of that signal by converting to a digital value.  _Ones and zeros_ 

## RTDs versus ðŸ¥Š

The other popular type is a thermocouple which uses voltage difference across a bimetal probe to determine temp.  Thermocouples are good cheap and reliable and only ever require 2 wires to work.  Since voltage is the property at play determining the temperature here, thermocouples are sensitive to electrical disturbances and can be unfit for applications that require long wire runs.
