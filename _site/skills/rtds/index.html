<h1>Resistance Temperature Detectors</h1>
<p>(RTDs) are the industry standard temperature sensor using electrical resistance as the property that changes due to temp.  They are sold as 2,3,and 4 wire devices and the more wires the higher the <strong>precision</strong>.</p>
<h2>Analog or digital?</h2>
<p>Well, they are both. The electrical signal physically traveling through the sensor is <em>analog</em> but an rtd sensor is always attached to some type of controller or input device that is responsible for providing the sensor with a source and making sense of that signal by converting it to a digital value.  <em>Ones and zeros</em></p>
<h2>RTDs versus</h2>
<p>The other popular type is a thermocouple which uses voltage difference across a bimetal probe to determine temp</p>
