- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rosseyg
- 👀 My expertise is in plc programming.  I am the inventor of the code that runs the nation's first all-in-one polymer delivery system!
- 🌱 Currently working on front-end web development which is much different from the world of plcs.
- 💞️ I’m looking for talented plc programmers that may want to collaborate.
